## Description
WizardWarz is a ThreeJS WebGL/Javascript multiplayer shoot-em-up game. It has unique generated maps with a NodeJS backend where maps are generated and it also supports multiplayer.

**This is a project that I've abandoned and just like to share with others as an example**

The game implements the following (and more):
- Generation of smooth landscape "Islands"
- Very basic multiplayer support
- nodejs server with game logic and map generation
- No actual limit of number of players, but it has only been tested with about 10 players.
- Model loading
- Animated models (exported from blender)
- Modified particle engine
- Both 3rd and 1st person view during gameplay
- Scoreboard
- Player toplist
- User account creation
- Levels + different character clothing depending on level.
- magic-spells!!!

## Testing

Install nodejs and run *"cd server; nodejs server.js"*. Then point your browser to *http://localhost:8080*
